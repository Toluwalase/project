 <p class="profile">I am a motivated, hard-working individual with a curious mind. I am always willing to learn and improve on myself as well as my technical skills, by using websites such as Codeacademy, code school, w3school and StackOverflow. I have the ability to work under pressure and prioritise my time whilst maintaining high customer service at work. My role at work has enabled me to work at a fast pace under pressure and also work in a team. I am currently working as a customer service assistant which makes me the first point of contact to customers, so I make sure I actively listen to what customers are saying and use my initiative to solve any problem that they may be facing.</p>

<li>I am responsible for delivering great customer service through selling tickets and food.</li>
<li>Responsible for upselling to achieve the business targets and increase the profit.</li>
<li>Responsible for keeping up-to-date with new movies in order to suggest the best movies for customers to watch.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h4>Sainsburys, Holborm, 2014- 2015</h4>

<p>My main duties includes working in a team of about 4-6 people on the till, stocking and also helping customers pack their groceries. As we get customers from around the world I make sure I listen and communicate with them clearly and directly in order for us to have a mutual understanding. I have self-control when dealing with difficult customers as itâ€™s necessary to be professional within the work place.  Customers are always pleased with the way I help them and communicate with them in a friendly and respectable manner, I received 100% with a mystery shopper which was the first ever time a Sainsburys staff member has received it in many years; I have helped the company with my attitude and my willingness to work and help others.</p>

<h4>M&S, Marble Arch, 2014- 2015</h4>
<p>I had to find a balance with going to work and studying in which I managed to do well. Working whilst at university allowed me to prioritise my time well and also taught me how to multi task and I was able to deliver high customer service skills and grades. Working in M&S I was a general assistant, I was mainly on the shop floor helping customers, fixing areas, on the tills when it got busy and also in the fitting rooms. A number of customers told the managers how helpful I was with them and also appreciated the advice I gave to them. I regularly upsaled whilst advising customers and I would recommend a complimentary item which increased the store sales.</p>
